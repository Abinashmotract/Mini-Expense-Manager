Assignment: Build a Mini Expense Manager
Please create a small full-stack application that allows users to track their daily expenses. The app should include the following features:

Core Features

Add Expense Manually
    Fields: Date, Amount, Vendor Name, Description
    Automatically assign a category based on vendor name (e.g., “Swiggy” → “Food”)
Upload via CSV
    Support uploading a CSV file containing multiple expense entries
    Parse and save these entries in the backend
Rule-Based Categorization
    Maintain a vendor-to-category mapping
    Apply the mapping automatically during expense entry
Anomaly Detection
    If an expense is more than 3× the average amount for its category, flag it as an anomaly
    Display these flagged anomalies distinctly in the UI
Dashboard Summary
    Show monthly totals per category
    Display top 5 vendors by total spend
    Count and list anomalies
